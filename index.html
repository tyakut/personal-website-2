                        <p>Hi, my name is Tibet. I'm a third year student at UC Berkeley, studying Data Science and Philosophy. I love to read, hike, travel, try new foods, and spend time with my amazing mom and family. I care deeply about living intentionally and avoiding digital addiction, finding meaning instead through small, genuine moments of connection in our everyday lives.</p>
                        <p>I was born in New York and grew up in New Jersey, but I travel to Türkiye as often as I can to visit my extended family, share good food, and explore new places. I'm also the Co-President of the Turkish Student Association at Berkeley, where I help other students stay connected to our shared heritage and culture here on campus.</p>
                        <p>Music has always been a big part of who I am: I grew up playing violin and piano, and now I digitally produce music and lead REVERB, a DJing and music production club on campus. I lead and have lead creative and cultural communities that bring people together through music, mentorship, and shared identity, driving projects at the intersection of technology and social impact. Last semester, I joined the fraternity Kappa Alpha Order looking to continue to shape my values through reverence, leadership and brotherhood.</p>
                        <p>I'm curious by nature, I love to ask questions, to learn, and to think deeply about the world. My friends say I have a strong moral compass, and an uncanny ability to turn any casual moment into a deep conversation. One of my strongest qualities is empathy, I have the unique ability to put myself in another person's perspective, even when they differ from my own, which guides both my leadership and personal interactions.</p>
